## **🚀 Vite + React Gemini AI Chatbot**
### **Overview**  
This project is built using **Vite + React** to integrate the **Gemini AI API** for generating responses.  

### **📌 Key Concepts**  
1. **What is Vite?**  
   - Vite is a fast **bundler** that compiles and serves React applications efficiently.  

2. **Core Features of the Project**  
   - **Gemini API Integration**  
   - **React State Management** (`useState`, `useEffect`)  
   - **Global State Sharing** using `useContext` & `createContext` (Most important for managing state across components)  

3. **What I Learned**  
    - Implementing a **loading mechanism**  
    - How different components **access and update state variables**  
    - Focused on **React logic**, ignored CSS for now  
    - Overall, found it **easy to implement**  

4. **🚧 Incomplete Features (To-Do)**  
   - **History Section** is still **incomplete**  
   - Need to store and display **chat history**

### **🔧 How to Run the Project**  
```bash
npm install  # Install dependencies
npm run dev  # Start the Vite development server
```

**🛠️ Future Improvements:**  
- Improve **UI & Styling**  
- Enhance **State Management** for better performance
